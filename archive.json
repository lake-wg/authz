This is more or less equivalent to the \"assertion\" item in BRSKI's Voucher, with the difference that no claim is made about \"how to verify the ownership of V upon U\". Another reason that motivated me in considering this field was a discussion I had with @chrysn about the \"admin status of V\".\r\n- `directives-for-u` should contain any information that W may find useful to transmit to U. In a way, this is still equivalent to `opaque_data`, but just with a name that conveys the intention of the field.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- does `role-of-v` make sense? are there other roles that should be considered?\r\n- is there anything else that is missing? is there other type of information that should / could be sent in the Voucher, that would not be covered by the suggested fields?",

Specifying the fields `role-of-v` and `directives-for-u`\r\nDuring a design team meeting on April 11, we discussed that the two items discussed above could be specified in an appendix (therefore keeping `OPAQUE_INFO` as part of the Voucher).\r\n\r\nThe concern here is making the protocol too closed, while we are still not sure of all potential use cases and needs.\r\n\r\nJust as a quick note, to me this starts to resemble a bit the case of EAP, where the main protocol is specified in a higher level, and then certain details are defined in later specifications. It differs from EAP as the authentication *is defined* (it relies on EDHOC's), but is similar to EAP as the underlying transport *is not defined*. Might bring this discussion into a separate issue.\r\n\r\n### 2. `directives-for-u`: use case with LoRaWAN\r\nThe Join-accept message defined in LoRaWAN v1.1 \u00b9 is sent as a response to a successful Join-request.\r\nJoin-accept contains the following fields: JoinNonce, Home_NetID, DevAddr, DownLinkSettings, RxDelay, ChannelFrequencyList.\r\n\r\nThus, when using `lake-authz` with LoRaWAN, the `directives-for-u` field could contain the fields of a Join-accept message.\r\n\r\n\u00b9 https://resources.lora-alliance.org/technical-specifications/lorawan-specification-v1-1",

The organization may run that on their own (in which case they'd probably pick LOC_W=\"\" and take the risk of just seeing many decryption failures whenever they encounter devices of someone else who does the same), or they may use any global provider, where the number of providers should be smaller than the number of organizations using them in any area (maybe 4=len(\"GAMA\")...).\r\n\r\nUsing authz, this could be used like this:\r\n(U = machine, V = phone, W = trustservice; as part of their enrollment, U has learned the public key of W and W knows the mapping from ID_U to CRED_U plus which account this is on, V has a secure channel with W associated with a customer account)\r\n* U sends message 1 with its ID_U\r\n* V sends the ENC_U_INFO to W\r\n* W verifies that V is on the same customer account as U, and returns CRED_U as well as a voucher response.\r\n  I'm not sure we even need to use the voucher here -- all that V needed to know that this is \"one of its own\", and knowing this it can now send its CRED_V (probably by value), and that will suffice to U\r\n* V sends its CRED_U\r\n* U recognizes the CRED_U and ... either sends a KID ID_CRED_V which suffices for this V, or if it turns out that V didn't contact W and just was generous with its CRED_V, maybe V sent something to ask for the full certificate.\r\n\r\nIs that in scope as an application for authz? I think it'd work with authz as-is, and at most need some wording that \"it is fine if the voucher response comes back OK without containing a voucher, V should then just continue like that\".

Privacy of `u_hints`\r\n- At U: gateways (Vs) normally advertise their radio identifiers in beacons -> no issue.\r\n- At V: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n- At W: the radio identifiers of any V will be read by W\r\n  - \u26a0\ufe0f potential issue: if W shares the identifiers with 3rd parties\r\n  - mitigation: W should commit to not share the received identifiers.\r\n- in transit between U <-> V and V <-> W: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n\r\n### 2. Privacy of `v_hints`\r\n- At W: the radio identifiers of Vs that are securely associated with W will be read by W\r\n  - \u26a0\ufe0f potential issue: if W shares the identifiers with 3rd parties\r\n  - mitigation: W should commit to not share the received identifiers.\r\n  - \u2753note: since Vs are already associated with W, the Vs should already trust W to not share any information with 3rd parties. Thus I think this is a non-issue.\r\n- At V: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n- At U: the device U will gain information about Vs that allow U to enroll. \r\n  - \u26a0\ufe0f potential issue: if the device is malicious, it would be learning new information about the system\r\n  - mitigation: only return hints when U is known to W.\r\n    - example 1: device u1 is listed in W's ACL, but the V through which it tried to join is not in the ACL (leading to error \"Access Denied\"). Since W knows u1, it MAY return `v_hints`.\r\n    - example 2: device u2 is not listed in W's ACL (leading to error \"Access Denied\"). Since W does not know u2, it MUST NOT return `v_hints`.\r\n  - \u2753 note: is there an issue when U is known by W (as in example 1 above)? It would be learning about radio identifiers of Vs that might or might not be in its radio range and are expected to be authorized to enroll U. Personally I think this is a non-issue.\r\n- in transit between W <-> V and V <-> U: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nI think that the only issues that we need to address in the document are `1. Privacy of u_hints at W` and `2. Privacy of v_hints at U (when U is unknown to W)`.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to receiving comments from those interested in this topic.",

Also, as a result of the present discussion, I think we can entirely discard the idea of sending GPS coordinates.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that just by having U trying to enroll via V, this already leaks some location information to W. For example, in Bluetooth or IEEE 802.15.4 or Wi-Fi one can easily expect a geolocation accuracy of a few tens of meters, given the MAC address of just one gateway. Of course triangulation of more gateways can improve that, but I would say e.g. 50 meters is already quite sensitive.\r\n\r\nNext, IIUC, your concerns regard only hints from U to W. Do you have concerns with the other way around? (where the manufacturer sends identifiers of gateways to a known device).\r\n\r\nI am taking a look at what the performance improvements could look like, might come back later with data.",

Specifically:\r\n- considering 10 available Vs and 5 hint items per message\r\n  - 3x faster join time, considering a 250 Kbps network with a scheduling timeslot of 10 ms (typical TSCH configuration)\r\n  - 2x faster join time, considering a 1 Mbps network with no scheduling cost (typical in Bluetooth)\r\n\r\nHints are more effective the more Vs there are available (e.g. may lead to a 10x improvement under certain conditions, provided there are > 25 available Vs). If available Vs = 5, there is no difference.

For example we could:\r\n1. just tag a whole array, and all elements will have the same meaning\r\n2. put the tag as first element in the array\r\n\r\nThe advantage of (1) is using the tag as a proper tag, but the disadvantage is that the change in semantics of the data item might be misleading.\r\nAs for (2), it does not cause confusion with tag semantics, but it feels a bit hacky.",

(10) Reversing EDHOC roles in the lake-authz architecture. In this case V = I = CoAP client, U = R = CoAP server. \r\n\r\n11. (11) Reversal in cases 1 and 2 combined, i.e. U = R = CoAP client sends a CoAP request trigger message to V = I = CoAP server, which responds with message_1 etc. \r\n\r\nBroadcast/multicast/etc. of trigger seems useful at least in case 1, as discussed above, and does not seem harmful in case 3. \r\n\r\nHowever, broadcast of message_1 may be an issue. It may be tempting for applications to use multiple sessions resulting from different endpoints responding to the same message_1. The security analyses made for EDHOC may not apply if G_X is reused. Moreover, the same connection identifier C_I intended to be used by the Initiator to distinguish between sessions is now used by the Initiator in multiple sessions (which also means special care needed for OSCORE sessions for which different Sender/Recipient Identifiers are required).\r\n\r\nCan we restrict multicast to the trigger message, or what functionality / optimization would be lost if we do?\r\n\r\n",

V supports lake-authz as a protocol. This can be indicated by the presence of an `authz-protocol` information element of type int and value TBD1.\r\n2. V is part of a particular instance/system implementing lake-authz (analogy: eduroam is an instance of EAP). This can be indicated by an `authz-instance` information element of type bstr whose value is specified by the application.\r\n\r\nThe exact formatting of the `authz-protocol` and `authz-instance` values is out of scope of this specification, as it depends on how each lower layer formats its advertisement packets.\r\n\r\nWhen U receives an advertisement containing either of these fields, this information should be made available to the application, which may use it to prioritize the selection of a suitable V.",

          "body": "The \"broadcast on the network layer\" is now also an example in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-amsuess-core-coap-over-gatt/07/ (section 4.2). Especially in combination with NIPC, this looks promising as a way to keep radio traffic for unenrolled devices low. But the way it is presented there right now, the default U=I setup holds, but I acts as the CoAP server, so it's reverse flow. It does technically send the first message, but that is a one-shot message expressed as an unsolicited response. (One might also do things subtly differently and invent a new flow, where I POSTs msg_1 with No-Response and waits for R to reverse roles mid-flight, which I don't see anything problematic with, but the phrasing as \"it's a response to a POST the client didn't send\" works well and is easier on the EDHOC-CoAP side of explanations).",
