Lightweight Authorization using Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (ELA)
                      draft-ietf-lake-authz-latest

Abstract

   Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) is a lightweight
   authenticated key exchange protocol intended for use in constrained
   scenarios.  This document specifies Lightweight Authorization using
   EDHOC (ELA).  The procedure allows authorizing enrollment of new
   devices using the extension point defined in EDHOC.  ELA is
   applicable to zero-touch onboarding of new devices to a constrained
   network leveraging trust anchors installed at manufacture time.

1.  Introduction

   For constrained IoT deployments [RFC7228] the overhead and processing
   contributed by security protocols may be significant, which motivates
   the specification of lightweight protocols that are optimizing, in
   particular, message overhead (see [I-D.ietf-lake-reqs]).  This
   document describes Lightweight Authorization using EDHOC (ELA), a
   procedure for augmenting the lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman
   key exchange EDHOC [RFC9528] with third party-assisted authorization.

   ELA involves a device, a domain authenticator, and an enrollment
   server.  The device and domain authenticator perform mutual
   authentication and authorization, assisted by the enrollment server
   that provides relevant authorization information to the device (a
   "voucher") and to the authenticator.  The high-level model is similar
   to BRSKI [RFC8995].

   In this document, we consider the target interaction for which
   authorization is needed to be "enrollment", for example joining a
   network for the first time (e.g., [RFC9031]), but it can be applied
   to authorize other target interactions.

   The enrollment server may represent the manufacturer of the device,
   or some other party with information about the device from which a
   trust anchor has been pre-provisioned into the device.  The (domain)
   authenticator may represent the service provider or some other party
   controlling access to the network in which the device is enrolling.

   ELA assumes that authentication between device and authenticator is
   performed with EDHOC [RFC9528], and defines the integration of a
   lightweight authorization procedure using the External Authorization
   Data (EAD) fields defined in EDHOC.

   ELA enables a low message count by performing authorization and
   enrollment in parallel with authentication, instead of in sequence,
   which is common for network access.  It further reuses protocol
   elements from EDHOC, leading to reduced message sizes on constrained
   links.

   This protocol is applicable to a wide variety of settings, and can be
   mapped to different authorization architectures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to have an understanding of CBOR [RFC8949], CDDL
   [RFC8610], and EDHOC [RFC9528].  Appendix C.1 of [RFC9528] contains
   some basic info about CBOR.

2.  Protocol Outline

   The goal of ELA is to enable a (potentially constrained) device (U)
   to enroll into a domain over a constrained link.  The device
   authenticates and enforces authorization of the (non-constrained)
   domain authenticator (V) with the help of a voucher conveying
   authorization information.  The voucher has a similar role as in
   [RFC8366] but should be considerably more compact.  The domain
   authenticator, in turn, authenticates the device and authorizes its
   enrollment into the domain.

   The procedure is assisted by a (non-constrained) enrollment server
   (W) located in a non-constrained network behind the domain
   authenticator, e.g., on the Internet, providing information to the
   device (conveyed in the voucher) and to the domain authenticator as
   part of the protocol.

   The objective of this document is to specify such a protocol that is
   lightweight over the constrained link, by reusing elements of EDHOC
   [RFC9528] and by shifting message overhead to the non-constrained
   side of the network.  See illustration in Figure 1.

   Note the cardinality of the involved parties.  It is expected that
   the domain authenticator needs to handle a large unspecified number
   of devices, but for a given device type or manufacturer it is
   expected that one or a few nodes host enrollment servers.

                 Voucher

       Figure 1: Overview of the message flow.  EDHOC is used on the
      constrained link between U and V.  Voucher Info and Voucher are
         sent in EDHOC External Authorization Data (EAD).  The link
                    between V and W is not constrained.

3.  Assumptions

   The protocol is based on the following pre-existing relations between
   the device (U), the domain authenticator (V) and the enrollment
   server (W), see Figure 2.

   *  U and W have an explicit relation: U is configured with a public
      key of W, see Section 3.1.

   *  V and W have an implicit relation, e.g., based on web PKI with
      trusted CA certificates, see Section 3.2.

   *  U and V need not have any previous relation.  This protocol
      establishes a relation between U and V.

   Each of the three parties can gain protected communication with the
   other two during the protocol.

   V may be able to access credentials over non-constrained networks,
   but U may be limited to constrained networks.  Implementations
   wishing to leverage the zero-touch capabilities of this protocol are
   expected to support transmission of credentials from V to U by value
   during the EDHOC exchange, which will impact the message size
   depending on the type of credential used.

              Figure 2: Overview of pre-existing relations.

3.1.  Device (U)

   To authenticate to V, the device (U) runs EDHOC in the role of
   Initiator with authentication credential CRED_U, for example, an
   X.509 certificate [RFC5280] or a CBOR Web Token (CWT, [RFC8392]).
   CRED_U may, for example, be carried by value in ID_CRED_I of EDHOC
   message_3 or be provisioned to V over a non-constrained network,
   leveraging a credential identifier in ID_CRED_I (see bottom of
   Figure 3).

   U also needs to identify itself to W.  The device identifier used for
   this is ID_U.  The purpose of ID_U is for W to be able to determine
   if the device with this identifier is authorized to enroll with V.
   ID_U may be a reference to CRED_U, like ID_CRED_I in EDHOC (see
   Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528]), or a device identifier from a different
   name space, such as EUI-64 identifiers.

   U is also provisioned with information about W:

   *  A static public DH key of W (G_W) used to establish secure
      communication with the enrollment server (see Section 4.4).

   *  Location information about the enrollment server (LOC_W) that can
      be used by V to reach W.  This is typically a URI but may
      alternatively be only the domain name.

3.2.  Domain Authenticator (V)

   To authenticate to U, the domain authenticator (V) runs EDHOC in the
   role of Responder with an authentication credential CRED_V containing
   a public key of V, see Section 4.5.2.1.  This proves to U the
   possession of the private key corresponding to the public key of
   CRED_V.  CRED_V typically needs to be transported to U in EDHOC
   (using ID_CRED_R = CRED_V, see Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528]) since
   there is no previous relation between U and V.

   V and W need to establish a secure (confidentiality and integrity
   protected) connection for the Voucher Request/Response protocol.
   Furthermore, W needs to access the same credential CRED_V that V uses
   with U (to compute the Voucher), and V needs to prove to W the
   possession of the private key corresponding to the public key of
   CRED_V.  It is RECOMMENDED that V authenticates to W using the same
   credential CRED_V as with U.

   Note that the choice of protocols may affect which type of credential
   and methods should be used by V.  For example, in case V and W select
   TLS for the secure channel and PoP, then CRED_V is a X.509
   certificate, and the EDHOC method used by V is signature-based.  Some
   of the possible combinations of protocols to secure the connection
   between V and W are listed in Table 1 below.

   Note also that the secure connection between V and W may be long-
   lived and reused for multiple voucher requests/responses.

   Other details of proof-of-possession related to CRED_V and transport
   of CRED_V are out of scope of this document.

3.3.  Enrollment Server (W)

   The enrollment server (W) is assumed to have the private DH key
   corresponding to G_W, which is used to establish secure communication
   with the device (see Section 4.4).  W provides to U the authorization
   decision for enrollment with V in the form of a voucher (see
   Section 4.4.2).  Authorization policies are out of scope for this
   document.

   Authentication credentials and communication security with V is
   described in Section 3.2.  To calculate the voucher, W needs access
   to message_1 and CRED_V as used in the EDHOC session between U and V,
   see Section 4.4.2.

   *  W MUST verify that CRED_V is bound to the secure connection
      between W and V

   *  W MUST verify that V is in possession of the private key
      corresponding to the public key of CRED_V

   W needs to be available during the execution of the protocol between
   U and V.

4.  The Protocol

4.1.  Overview

   The ELA protocol consist of three security sessions going on in
   parallel:

   1.  The EDHOC session between device (U) and (domain) authenticator
       (V)

   2.  Voucher Request/Response between authenticator (V) and enrollment
       server (W)

   3.  An exchange of voucher-related information, including the voucher
       itself, between device (U) and enrollment server (W), mediated by
       the authenticator (V).

   Figure 3 provides an overview of the message flow detailed in this
   section.  An outline of EDHOC is given in Section 2 of [RFC9528].

  Figure 3: Overview of ELA: W-assisted authorization of U and V to
   each other: EDHOC between U and V, and Voucher Request/Response
    between V and W.  Before the protocol, V and W are assumed to
      have established a secure channel and performed proof-of-
    possession of relevant keys.  Credential lookup of CRED_U may
               involve W or other credential database.

4.2.  Reuse of EDHOC

   The ELA protocol illustrated in Figure 3 reuses several components of
   EDHOC:

   *  G_X, the ephemeral public Diffie-Hellman key of U, is also used in
      the protocol between U and W.  In case U acts as Responder (see
      Section 4.8), G_Y is used instead.

   *  SUITES_I includes the cipher suite for EDHOC selected by U, and
      also defines the algorithms used between U and W (see Section 3.6
      of [RFC9528]):

      -  EDHOC AEAD algorithm: used to encrypt ID_U and to generate
         voucher

      -  EDHOC hash algorithm: used for key derivation

      -  EDHOC key exchange algorithm: used to calculate the shared
         secret between U and W

   *  EAD_1, EAD_2 are the External Authorization Data message fields of
      message_1 and message_2, respectively, see Section 3.8 of
      [RFC9528].  In case U acts as Responder (see Section 4.8), EAD_2
      and EAD_3 are used in message_2 and message_3, respectively.  This
      document specifies two new EAD items, with ead_label = TBD1 and
      TBD2, see Section 7.1.

   *  ID_CRED_I and ID_CRED_R are used to identify the authentication
      credentials CRED_U and CRED_V, respectively.  As shown at the
      bottom of Figure 3, V may use W to obtain CRED_U.  By default,
      CRED_V is transported in ID_CRED_R in message_2, see
      Section 4.5.2.1.  In case U is Responder, CRED_V is transported in
      ID_CRED_I in message_3.

   The protocol also reuses the EDHOC_Extract and EDHOC_Expand key
   derivation from EDHOC (see Section 4 of [RFC9528]).

   *  The intermediate pseudo-random key PRK is derived using
      EDHOC_Extract():

      -  PRK = EDHOC_Extract(salt, IKM)

         o  where salt = 0x (the zero-length byte string)

         o  IKM is computed as an ECDH cofactor Diffie-Hellman shared
            secret from the public key of W, G_W, and the private key
            corresponding to G_X (or v.v.), see Section 5.7.1.2 of
            [NIST-800-56A].

   The output keying material OKM is derived from PRK using
   EDHOC_Expand(), which is defined in terms of the EDHOC hash algorithm
   of the selected cipher suite SS, see Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528]:

   *  OKM = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length)

      where

   info = (
      info_label : int,
      context : bstr,
      length : uint,
   )

4.3.  Stateless Operation of V

   V may act statelessly with respect to U: the state of the EDHOC
   session started by U may be dropped at V until authorization from W
   is received.  Once V has received EDHOC message_1 from U and
   extracted LOC_W from EAD_1, message_1 is forwarded unmodified to W in
   the form of a Voucher Request (see Section 4.6.1).  V encapsulates
   the internal state that it needs to later respond to U, and sends
   that to W together with EDHOC message_1.  This state typically
   contains addressing information of U (e.g., U's IP address and port
   number), together with any other implementation-specific parameter
   needed by V to respond to U.  At this point, V can drop the EDHOC
   session that was initiated by U.

   The encapsulated state MUST be protected using a uniformly-
   distributed (pseudo-)random key, known only to itself and specific
   for the current EDHOC session to prevent replay attacks of old
   encapsulated state.

   How V serializes and encrypts its internal state is out of scope in
   this specification.  For example, V may use CBOR and COSE.

   Editor's note: Consider to include an example of serialized internal
   state.

   W sends to V the voucher together with the echoed message_1, as
   received from U, and V's internal state, see Section 4.6.2.  This
   allows V to act as a simple message relay until it has obtained the
   authorization from W to enroll U.  The reception of a successful
   Voucher Response at V from W implies the authorization for V to
   enroll U.  At this point, V can initialize a new EDHOC session with
   U, based on the message and the state retrieved from the Voucher
   Response from W.

   Noet that while stateless operation is supported in the default flow,
   it is not supported in the reverse flow (see Section 4.8).

4.4.  Device <-> Enrollment Server (U <-> W)

   The protocol between U and W is carried between U and V in message_1
   and message_2 (Section 4.5), and between V and W in the Voucher
   Request/Response (Section 4.6).  The data is protected between the
   endpoints using secret keys derived from a Diffie-Hellman shared
   secret (see Section 4.2) as further detailed in this section.

4.4.1.  Voucher Info

   The external authorization data EAD_1 contains an EAD item with
   ead_label = TBD1 and ead_value = Voucher_Info, which is a CBOR byte
   string:

   Voucher_Info = bstr .cborseq Voucher_Info_Seq

   Voucher_Info_Seq = [ ; used as a CBOR sequence, not array
       LOC_W:      tstr,
       ENC_U_INFO:     bstr
   ]

   where

   *  LOC_W is a text string used by V to locate W, e.g., a URI or a
      domain name.

   *  ENC_U_INFO is a byte string containing an encrypted identifier of
      U and, optionally, opaque application data prepared by U.  It is
      calculated as follows:

   ENC_U_INFO is encrypted using the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the
   selected cipher suite SS specified in SUITE_I of EDHOC message_1.  It
   consists of 'ciphertext' of COSE_Encrypt0 (Section 5.2 of [RFC9052])
   computed from the following:

   *  The encryption key K_1 and nonce IV_1 are derived as specified
      below.

   *  'protected' is a byte string of size 0

   *  'plaintext' and 'external_aad' as below:

   plaintext = (
       ID_U:            bstr,
   )

   external_aad = [ ; used as a CBOR sequence, not array
       "ELA-voucher-info": tstr, ; fixed label
       METHOD:             int,
       SS:                 int,
       C_I:                bstr
   ]

   where

   *  "ELA-voucher-info" is a string literal for the Voucher_Info
      struct.

   *  ID_U is an identifier of the device, see Section 3.1.

   *  METHOD is the authentication method of EDHOC message_1.

   *  SS is the selected cipher suite in SUITES_I of EDHOC message_1,
      see Section 4.5.

   *  C_I is the connection identifier of EDHOC message_1.

   The external_aad is wrapped in an enc_structure as defined in
   Section 5.3 of [RFC9052].

   Editor's note: Add more context to external_aad.

   The derivation of K_1 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see OKM in Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 0

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the key of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes
      (which is the length of K_1)

   The derivation of IV_1 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see OKM in Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 1

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the nonce of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes
      (which is the length of IV_1)

4.4.2.  Voucher

   The external authorization data EAD_2 contains an EAD item with
   ead_label = TBD2 and ead_value = Voucher.

   The voucher is an assertion to U that W has authorized V.  It is
   encrypted using the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the selected cipher suite
   SS specified in SUITE_I of EDHOC message_1.  It consists of the
   'ciphertext' field of a COSE_Encrypt0 object, which is a byte string,
   as defined below.

   Voucher = bstr

   Its corresponding plaintext value consists of an opaque field that
   can be used by W to convey information to U, such as a voucher scope.
   The authentication tag present in the ciphertext is also bound to
   message_1 and the credential of V as described below.

   *  The encryption key K_2 and nonce IV_2 are derived as specified
      below.

   *  'protected' is a byte string of size 0

   *  'plaintext' and 'external_aad' as below:

   plaintext = (
       ?OPAQUE_INFO: bstr
   )

   external_aad = (
       H_handshake:  bstr,
       CRED_V:        bstr,
   )

   where

   *  OPAQUE_INFO is an opaque field provided by the application.  If
      present, it will contain application data that W may want to
      convey to U, e.g., a voucher scope.  Note that OPAQUE_INFO is
      opaque when viewed as an information element in EDHOC.  It is
      opaque to V, while the application in U and W can read its
      contents.

   *  H_handshake is the hash of EDHOC message_1, sent by V as part of
      the voucher request, see Section 4.6.1.

   *  CRED_V is the credential used by V to authenticate to U and W, see
      Section 4.5.2.1 and Table 1.

   The derivation of K_2 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 2

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the key of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes

   The derivation of IV_2 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 3

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the nonce of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes

4.5.  Device <-> Authenticator (U <-> V)

   This section describes the processing in U and V, which includes the
   EDHOC protocol, see Figure 3.  Normal EDHOC processing is omitted
   here.

4.5.1.  Message 1

4.5.1.1.  Processing in U

   U composes EDHOC message_1 using authentication method, identifiers,
   etc. according to an agreed application profile, see Section 3.9 of
   [RFC9528].  The selected cipher suite, in this document denoted SS,
   applies also to the interaction with W as detailed in Section 4.2, in
   particular, with respect to the Diffie-Hellman key agreement
   algorithm used between U and W.  As part of the normal EDHOC
   processing, U generates the ephemeral public key G_X that is reused
   in the interaction with W, see Section 4.4.

   The device sends EDHOC message_1 with EAD item (-TBD1, Voucher_Info)
   included in EAD_1, where Voucher_Info is specified in Section 4.4.
   The negative sign indicates that the EAD item is critical, see
   Section 3.8 of [RFC9528].

4.5.1.2.  Processing in V

   V receives EDHOC message_1 from U and processes it as specified in
   Section 5.2.3 of [RFC9528], with the additional step of processing
   the EAD item in EAD_1.  Since the EAD item is critical, if V does not
   recognize it or it contains information that V cannot process, then V
   MUST abort the EDHOC session, see Section 3.8 of [RFC9528].
   Otherwise, the ead_label = TBD1 triggers the voucher request to W as
   described in Section 4.6.  The exchange between V and W needs to be
   completed successfully for the EDHOC session to be continued.

   Note that the selected cipher suite SS is used both in the U <-> W
   and U <-> V interactions, therefore V must be ready to use the cipher
   suite SS set by U in message_1.  That is, ELA restricts the cipher
   suite negotiation in order to provide a streamlined authorization
   flow from the perspective of U.  Since V has a pre-established
   trusted channel with W, it has the opportunity to learn which cipher
   suites should be supported before any authorization attempt begins to
   take place.

4.5.2.  Message 2

4.5.2.1.  Processing in V

   V receives the voucher response from W as described in Section 4.6.

   V sends EDHOC message_2 to U with the critical EAD item (-TBD2,
   Voucher) included in EAD_2, i.e., ead_label = TBD2 and ead_value =
   Voucher, as specified in Section 4.4.2.

   The type of CRED_V may depend on the selected mechanism for the
   establishment of a secure channel between V and W, See Table 1.

   In case the network between U and V is constrained, it is recommended
   that CRED_V be a CWT Claims Set (CCS) [RFC8392].  The CCS contains
   the public authentication key of V encoded as a COSE_Key in the 'cnf'
   claim, see Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528].  ID_CRED_R contains the CWT
   Claims Set with 'kccs' as COSE header_map, see Section 10.6 of
   [RFC9528].

4.5.2.2.  Processing in U

   U receives EDHOC message_2 from V and processes it as specified in
   Section 5.3.3 of [RFC9528], with the additional step of processing
   the EAD item in EAD_2.

   If U does not recognize the EAD item or the EAD item contains
   information that U cannot process, then U MUST abort the EDHOC
   session, see Section 3.8 of [RFC9528].  Otherwise, U MUST verify the
   Voucher using H_message_1, CRED_V, and the keys derived as in
   Section 4.4.2.  If the verification fails then U MUST abort the EDHOC
   session.

   If OPAQUE_INFO is present, it is made available to the application.

4.5.3.  Message 3

4.5.3.1.  Processing in U

   If all verifications are passed, then U sends EDHOC message_3.

   EDHOC message_3 may be combined with an OSCORE-protected application
   request, see [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc].

4.5.3.2.  Processing in V

   V performs the normal EDHOC verifications of message_3.  V may
   retrieve CRED_U from a Credential Database, after having learned
   ID_CRED_I from U.

4.6.  Authenticator <-> Enrollment Server (V <-> W)

   It is assumed that V and W have set up a secure connection, W has
   accessed the authentication credential CRED_V to be used in the EDHOC
   session between V and U, and that W has verified that V is in
   possession of the private key corresponding to CRED_V, see
   Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.  V and W run the Voucher Request/
   Response protocol over the secure connection.

4.6.1.  Voucher Request

4.6.1.1.  Processing in V

   V sends the voucher request to W.  The Voucher Request SHALL be a
   CBOR array as defined below:

   Voucher_Request = [
       SS:             int,
       G_U:            bstr,
       Voucher_Info:   bstr,
       H_handshake:    bstr,
       ? opaque_state: bstr
   ]

   where

   *  SS is the selected cipher suite used in the EDHOC session between
      U and V

   *  G_U is the ephemeral public key (G_X) of U

   *  Voucher_Info is as extracted from the EAD_1 field of message_1

   *  H_handshake is the hash of message_1.  It is computed using the
      EDHOC hash algorithm of the selected cipher suite SS specified in
      SUITE_I of EDHOC message_1.

   *  opaque_state is OPTIONAL and represents the serialized and
      encrypted opaque state needed by V to statelessly respond to U
      after the reception of Voucher_Response.

4.6.1.2.  Processing in W

   W receives and parses the voucher request received over the secure
   connection with V.  W extracts from Voucher_Request:

   *  SS - the selected cipher suite, which is the (last) integer of
      SUITES_I.

   *  G_U - the ephemeral public key of U.

   *  ENC_U_INFO - the encryption of the device identifier ID_U,
      contained in the Voucher_Info field of Voucher_Request.

   *  H_handshake - the hash of message_1.

   W verifies and decrypts ENC_U_INFO using the relevant algorithms of
   the selected cipher suite SS (see Section 4.2), and obtains ID_U.

   W uses H_handshake as a session identifier, and associates it to the
   device identifier ID_U.  Note that message_1 contains a unique
   ephemeral key, therefore H_handshake is expected to be unique.

   If processing fails up until this point, the protocol SHALL be
   aborted with an error code signaling a generic issue with the
   request, see Section 5.4.1.

   W uses ID_U to look up the associated authorization policies for U
   and enforces them.  This is out of scope for the specification.

   If ID_U is known by W, but authorization fails, the protocol SHALL be
   aborted with an error code signaling an access control issue, see
   Section 4.7 and Section 5.4.1.

4.6.2.  Voucher Response

4.6.2.1.  Processing in W

   W retrieves CRED_V associated with the secure connection with V, and
   constructs the Voucher for the device with identifier ID_U (see
   Section 4.4.2).

   W generates the voucher response and sends it to V over the secure
   connection.  The Voucher_Response SHALL be a CBOR array as defined
   below:

   Voucher_Response = [
       Voucher:        bstr,
       ? opaque_state: bstr
   ]

   where

   *  The Voucher is defined in Section 4.4.2.

   *  opaque_state is the echoed byte string opaque_state from
      Voucher_Request, if present.

   W signals the successful generation of the voucher via a status code
   in the REST interface, as defined in Section 5.4.1.

4.6.2.2.  Processing in V

   V receives the voucher response from W over the secure connection.
   If present, V decrypts and verifies opaque_state as received from W.
   If that verification fails, then the EDHOC session with U is aborted.
   If the voucher response is successfully received from W, then V
   responds to U with EDHOC message_2 as described in Section 4.5.2.1.

4.7.  Error Handling

   This section specifies a new EDHOC error code and how it is used in
   ELA.

4.7.1.  EDHOC Error "Access denied"

   This section specifies the new EDHOC error "Access denied", see
   Figure 4.

  +----------+----------------+----------------------------------------+
  | ERR_CODE | ERR_INFO Type  | Description                            |
  +==========+================+========================================+
  |     TBD3 | error_content  | Access denied                          |
  +----------+----------------+----------------------------------------+

  Figure 4: EDHOC error code and error information for ‘Access denied’.

   Error code TBD3 is used to indicate to the receiver that access
   control has been applied and the sender has aborted the EDHOC
   session.  The ERR_INFO field contains error_content which is a CBOR
   Sequence consisting of an integer and an optional byte string.

   error_content = (
     REJECT_TYPE : int,
     ? REJECT_INFO : bstr,
   )

   The purpose of REJECT_INFO is for the sender to provide verifiable
   and actionable information to the receiver about the error, so that
   an automated action may be taken to enable access.

  +-------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+
  | REJECT_TYPE | REJECT_INFO   | Description                          |
  +=============+===============+======================================+
  |           0 | -             | No REJECT_INFO                       |
  +-------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+
  |           1 | bstr          | REJECT_INFO from trusted third party |
  +-------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+

        Figure 5: REJECT_TYPE and REJECT_INFO for ‘Access denied’.

4.7.2.  Error handling in W, V, and U

   ELA uses the EDHOC Error "Access denied" in the following way:

   *  W generates error_content and transfers it to V via the secure
      connection.  If REJECT_TYPE is 1, then REJECT_INFO is encrypted
      from W to U using the EDHOC AEAD algorithm.  W signals the error
      via an appropriate status code in the REST interface, as defined
      in Section 5.4.1.

   *  V receives error_content, prepares an EDHOC "Access denied" error,
      and sends it to U.

   *  U receives the error message and extracts the error_content.  If
      REJECT_TYPE is 1, then U decrypts REJECT_INFO, based on which it
      may retry to gain access.

   The encryption of REJECT_INFO follows a procedure analogous to the
   one defined in Section 4.4.2, with the following differences:

   plaintext = (
       OPAQUE_INFO:     bstr,
    )

   external_aad = (
       H_handshake:    bstr,
    )

   where

   *  OPAQUE_INFO is an opaque field that contains actionable
      information about the error.  It may contain, for example, a list
      of suggested Vs through which U should join instead.

   *  H_handshake is the hash of EDHOC message_1, calculated from the
      associated voucher request, see Section 4.6.1.

4.8.  Reverse flow with U as Responder

   This section presents a protocol variant in which U is the EDHOC
   Responder.  This may allow optimizations in certain constrained
   network technologies.  For example, one use case is having V
   broadcast message_1, to which U responds with a message_2 whose EAD_2
   field contains Voucher_Info.

   Note that this is different from the EDHOC reverse message flow
   defined in Appendix A.2.2 of [RFC9528], since we make no assumption
   about whether U or V is a CoAP server.

4.8.1.  U is the Initiator

   For clarity, we first present the "default flow" with U as Initiator,
   as described in Section 4.1 and Section 4.5.  Note that Voucher_Info
   and Voucher are carried in EDHOC message_1 and message_2,
   respectively.

         |                              +<---------------------------->|
         |                              |    (Voucher, ?opaque_state)
         |       EDHOC message_2        |
         +<-----------------------------|
         |   EAD_2 = (TBD2, Voucher)    |
         |                              |
         |       EDHOC message_3        |

         |                              |
         |                              |

          Figure 6: In ELA default flow, U is the EDHOC Initiator.

   In the ELA default flow, once message_2 processing is finalized
   (including processing of EAD_2), U considers V authenticated through
   W.

4.8.2.  U is the Responder

   ELA also works with U as the EDHOC Responder, a setup we refer to as
   the "ELA reverse flow", as shown in Figure 7.

   We present this variant as a set of changes to the regular protocol
   flow.  That is, here we only describe the differences in processing,
   when compared to the ELA default flow.

   Here is a summary of the changes needed in the ELA reverse flow:

   *  Voucher_Info and Voucher are transported in EDHOC message_2 and
      message_3, respectively (instead of message_1 and message_2).

   *  The EAD_2 and EAD_3 fields carry EAD items identified with labels
      TBD1 and TBD2, respectively.

   *  The VREQ / VRES protocol takes place between message_2 and
      message_3.

   *  The Voucher_Request carries G_Y instead of G_X, and the transcript
      hash TH_2 instead of the hash H_message_1.

   *  Stateless operation of V (see Section 4.3) is not supported

                Figure 7: ELA when U is the EDHOC Responder.

   The following detail how the processing changes in each of the three
   security sessions.

   The way to interpret the subsections below is as follows.  The ELA
   reverse flow described in this section uses most of the ELA default
   flow processing (Section 4.1 to Section 4.7), except by the changes
   detailed in Section 4.8.2.1, Section 4.8.2.2, and Section 4.8.2.3.

4.8.2.1.  Reverse U <-> W

   The protocol between U and W is carried between U and V in message_2
   and message_3, and between V and W in the Voucher Request/Response
   (Section 4.6).

   Voucher Info:

   *  The EAD_2 item has ead_label = TBD1 and ead_value = Voucher_Info.

   Voucher:

   *  H_handshake is the transcript hash TH_2, sent by V as part of the
      voucher request, see Section 4.8.2.3.

4.8.2.2.  Reverse U <-> V

   Message 1:

   *  V composes message_1 and sends it to U.

   *  U processes message_1 and extracts SS.

   Message 2:

   *  U composes message_2 and generates G_Y, which is reused in the
      interaction with W.

   *  U sends message_2 with EAD item (-TBD1, Voucher_Info) included in
      EAD_2.

   *  V processes message_2 and the EAD item in EAD_2, extracting the
      Voucher_Info struct.

   *  V sends the voucher request to W.

   Message 3:

   *  V receives the voucher response from W.

   *  V sends message_3 with EAD item (-TBD2, Voucher) included in
      EAD_3.

   *  Y processes message_3 and the EAD item in EAD_3.

4.8.2.3.  Reverse V <-> W

   Processing in V:

   *  The Voucher_Request fields are prepared as defined in
      Section 4.6.1, with the following changes:

      -  G_U is set to G_Y, which is the ephemeral public key of U as
         extracted from message_2.

      -  Voucher_Info is as extracted from the EAD_2 field of message_2.

      -  H_handshake is the transcript hash TH_2, computed by V as
         specified in Section 5.3.2 of [RFC9528].

   Processing in W happens as specified in Section 4.6.1.

4.8.3.  Interoperability considerations

   A Device (U) MUST implement one of the ELA flows, and it MAY choose
   to implement both.

   V MUST support the regular flow and MAY support the reverse flow.

   From the point of view of W, there is no difference whether U and V
   run as EDHOC Initiator or Responder.

4.8.4.  Security implications

   When using the reverse flow, U shares its identity before it can
   learn (1) V's identity and (2) whether or not the Voucher is valid.

   In the reverse flow, Voucher_Info is confidentiality and integrity
   protected, while Voucher is also authenticated.  These properties are
   inherited from EDHOC message_2 and message_3.  This is a higher level
   of protection than with the regular flow.

5.  REST Interface at W

   The interaction between V and W is enabled through a RESTful
   interface exposed by W.  This RESTful interface MAY be implemented
   using either HTTP or CoAP.  V SHOULD access the resources exposed by
   W through the protocol indicated by the scheme in the LOC_W URI.

5.1.  Scheme "https"

   In case the scheme indicates "https", V MUST perform a TLS handshake
   with W and access the resources defined in Section 5.4 using HTTP.
   If the authentication credential CRED_V can be used in a TLS
   handshake, e.g., an X.509 certificate of a signature public key, then
   V SHOULD use it to authenticate to W as a client.  If the
   authentication credential CRED_V cannot be used in a TLS handshake,
   e.g., if the public key is a static Diffie-Hellman key, then V SHOULD
   first perform a TLS handshake with W using available compatible keys.
   V MUST then perform an EDHOC session over the TLS connection proving
   to W the possession of the private key corresponding to CRED_V.
   Performing the EDHOC session is only necessary if V did not
   authenticate with CRED_V in the TLS handshake with W.

   Editor's note: Clarify that performing TLS handshake is not necessary
   for each device request; if there already is a TLS connection between
   V and W that should be reused.  Similar considerations for 5.2 and
   5.3.

5.2.  Scheme "coaps"

   In case the scheme indicates "coaps", V SHOULD perform a DTLS
   handshake with W and access the resources defined in Section 5.4
   using CoAP.  The normative requirements in Section 5.1 on performing
   the DTLS handshake and EDHOC session remain the same, except that TLS
   is replaced with DTLS.

5.3.  Scheme "coap"

   In case the scheme indicates "coap", V SHOULD perform an EDHOC
   session with W, as specified in Appendix A of [RFC9528] and access
   the resources defined in Section 5.4 using OSCORE and CoAP.  The
   authentication credential in this EDHOC session MUST be CRED_V.

5.4.  URIs

   The URIs defined below are valid for both HTTP and CoAP.  W MUST
   support the use of the path-prefix "/.well-known/", as defined in
   [RFC8615], and the registered name "lake-authz".  A valid URI in case
   of HTTP thus begins with

   *  "https://www.example.com/.well-known/lake-authz"

   In case of CoAP with DTLS:

   *  "coaps://example.com/.well-known/lake-authz"

   In case of EDHOC and OSCORE:

   *  "coap://example.com/.well-known/lake-authz"

   Each operation specified in the following is indicated by a path-
   suffix.

5.4.1.  Voucher Request (/voucherrequest)

   To request a voucher, V MUST issue a request such that:

   *  Method is POST

   *  Payload is the serialization of the Voucher Request object, as
      specified in Section 4.6.1.

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      voucherrequest+cbor"

   In case of successful processing at W, W MUST issue a response such
   that:

   *  Status code is 200 OK if using HTTP, or 2.04 Changed if using CoAP

   *  Payload is the serialized Voucher Response object, as specified in
      Section 4.6.2

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      voucherresponse+cbor"

   In case of error, two cases should be considered:

   *  U cannot be identified: this happens either if W fails to process
      the Voucher Request, or if it succeeds but ID_U is considered
      unknown to W.  In this case, W MUST reply with 400 Bad Request if
      using HTTP, or 4.00 if using CoAP.

   *  U is identified but unauthorized: this happens if W is able to
      process the Voucher Request, and W recognizes ID_U as a known
      device, but the access policies forbid enrollment.  For example,
      the policy could enforce enrollment within a delimited time
      window, via a specific V, etc.  In this case, W MUST reply with a
      403 Forbidden code if using HTTP, or 4.03 if using CoAP; the
      payload is the serialized error_content object, with Content-
      Format (Content-Type) set to "application/lake-authz-
      vouchererror+cbor".  The payload MAY be used by V to prepare an
      EDHOC error "Access Denied", see Section 4.7.

5.4.2.  Certificate Request (/certrequest)

   V requests the public key certificate of U from W through the
   "/certrequest" path-suffix.  To request U's authentication
   credential, V MUST issue a request such that:

   *  Method is POST

   *  Payload is the serialization of the ID_CRED_I object, as received
      in EDHOC message_3.

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      certrequest+cbor"

   In case of a successful lookup of the authentication credential at W,
   W MUST issue a response such that:

   *  Status code is 200 OK if using HTTP, or 2.04 Changed if using CoAP

   *  Payload is the serialized CRED_U

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      certresponse+cbor"

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification builds on and reuses many of the security
   constructions of EDHOC, e.g., shared secret calculation and key
   derivation.  The security considerations of EDHOC [RFC9528] apply
   with modifications discussed here.

   EDHOC provides identity protection of the Initiator, here the device.
   The encryption of the device identifier ID_U in the first message
   should consider potential information leaking from the length of
   ID_U, either by making all identifiers having the same length or the
   use of a padding scheme.

   Although W learns about the identity of U after receiving VREQ, this
   information must not be disclosed to V, until U has revealed its
   identity to V with ID_CRED_I in message_3.  W may be used for lookup
   of CRED_U from ID_CRED_I, or this credential lookup function may be
   separate from the authorization function of W, see Figure 3.  The
   trust model used here is that U decides to which V it reveals its
   identity.  In an alternative trust model where U trusts W to decide
   to which V it reveals U's identity, CRED_U could be sent in Voucher
   Response.

   As noted in Section 9.2 of [RFC9528] an ephemeral key may be used to
   calculate several ECDH shared secrets.  In this specification, the
   ephemeral key G_X is also used to calculate G_XW, the shared secret
   with the enrollment server.

   The private ephemeral key is thus used in the device for calculations
   of key material relating to both the authenticator and the enrollment
   server.  There are different options for where to implement these
   calculations.  One option is as an addition to EDHOC, i.e., to extend
   the EDHOC API in the device, so that EDHOC can import the public key
   of W (G_W) and the device identifier of U (ID_U), and then produce
   the encryption of ID_U which is included in Voucher_Info in EAD_1.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  EDHOC External Authorization Data Registry

   IANA has registered the following entries in the "EDHOC External
   Authorization Data" registry under the group name "Ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)".

          +=======+============+===============================+
          | Label | Value Type | Description                   |
          +=======+============+===============================+
          |  TBD1 | bstr       | Voucher_Info structure,       |
          |       |            | prepared by the Device (U).   |
          +-------+------------+-------------------------------+
          |  TBD2 | bstr       | Voucher structure, prepared   |
          |       |            | by the Enrollment Server (W). |
          +-------+------------+-------------------------------+

               Table 2: Addition to the EDHOC EAD registry

   The ead_label = TBD1 corresponds to the ead_value = Voucher_Info,
   which can be carried in either EAD_1 or EAD_2, depending on whether U
   acts as EDHOC Initiator or Responder, see Section 4.8.

   The ead_label = TBD2 corresponds to ead_value = Voucher, and can be
   carried in either EAD_2 or EAD_3, see Section 4.8.

   Note for IANA reviewers: the preferred value range is 0-23 (Standards
   Action with Expert Review).

7.2.  The Well-Known URI Registry

   IANA has registered the following entry in "The Well-Known URI
   Registry", using the template from [RFC8615]:

   *  URI suffix: lake-authz

   *  Change controller: IETF

   *  Specification document: [[this document]]

   *  Status: permanent

   *  Related information: None

7.3.  Well-Known Name Under ".arpa" Name Space

   This document allocates a well-known name under the .arpa name space
   according to the rules given in [RFC3172] and [RFC6761].  The name
   "lake-authz.arpa" is requested.  No subdomains are expected, and
   addition of any such subdomains requires the publication of an IETF
   Standards Track RFC.  No A, AAAA, or PTR record is requested.

7.3.1.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

   As required by [RFC6761], the following considerations apply to the
   reservation of "lake-authz.arpa":

   1.  Users: Are human users expected to recognize these names as
       special and use them differently?  In what way?

   No.  This name is not intended for direct use or recognition by human
   users.

   1.  Application Software: Are writers of application software
       expected to make their software recognize these names as special
       and treat them differently?  In what way?  (For example, if a
       human user enters such a name, should the application software
       reject it with an error message?)

   Yes. Applications that implement ELA and use CoAP may include "lake-
   authz.arpa" in the URI-Host option when the Device (U) does not yet
   know the address or identity of the Authenticator (V), such as during
   zero-touch enrollment.

   1.  Name Resolution APIs and Libraries: Are writers of name
       resolution APIs and libraries expected to make their software
       recognize these names as special and treat them differently?  If
       so, how?

   No.

   1.  Caching DNS Servers: Are developers of caching domain name
       servers expected to make their implementations recognize these
       names as special and treat them differently?  If so, how?

   No.

   1.  Authoritative DNS Servers: Are developers of authoritative domain
       name servers expected to make their implementations recognize
       these names as special and treat them differently?  If so, how?

   No.

   1.  DNS Server Operators: Does this reserved Special-Use Domain Name
       have any potential impact on DNS server operators?  If they try
       to configure their authoritative DNS server as authoritative for
       this reserved name, will compliant name server software reject it
       as invalid?  Do DNS server operators need to know about that and
       understand why?  Even if the name server software doesn't prevent
       them from using this reserved name, are there other ways that it
       may not work as expected, of which the DNS server operator should
       be aware?

   No.

   1.  DNS Registries/Registrars: How should DNS Registries/Registrars
       treat requests to register this reserved domain name?  Should
       such requests be denied?  Should such requests be allowed, but
       only to a specially designated entity?  (For example, the name
       "www.example.org" is reserved for documentation examples and is
       not available for registration; however, the name is in fact
       registered; and there is even a website at that name, which
       states circularly that the name is reserved for use in
       documentation and cannot be registered!)

   Any requests to register this domain name should be denied.

7.4.  Media Types Registry

   IANA has added the media types "application/lake-authz-
   voucherrequest+cbor" to the "Media Types" registry.

7.4.1.  application/lake-authz-voucherrequest+cbor Media Type

Appendix A.  Optimization Strategies

   When ELA is used for zero-touch enrollment of IoT devices, U may have
   little to no knowledge about V's available in its vicinity.  This may
   lead to situations where U retries several times at different V's
   until it finds one that works.  This section presents two
   optimization strategies for such cases.  They were developed to
   address scenarios where V's are radio gateways to which U wants to
   enroll, but may also be applicable to other use cases.

A.1.  U broadcasts message_1

   This strategy consists in U broadcasting EDHOC message_1.  When each
   of the V's in radio range of U receive message_1, one of the
   following can happen:

   *  V does not implement EDHOC, and drops the message

   *  V does not implement ELA, and since EAD_1 is critical, it either
      responds with an error or drops the message (Editor's note:
      dropping actually conflicts with the EAD field being critical)

   *  V forwards message_1 to W as VREQ, but W does not authorize it,
      and error handling is applied

   *  V forwards message_1 to W as VREQ, W authorizes it, and the
      protocol continues normally

   U is expected to receive and process at most one message_2 as
   response, which contains the Voucher.  In case U receives additional
   message_2's, they MUST be silently dropped.

   This strategy may increase the number of messages that need to be
   processed by V and W, in exchange for reducing resource usage in U.

   Security concerns related to this strategy, including potential reuse
   of G_X and double processing of message_2, are discussed in
   Section 6.

A.2.  V advertises support for ELA

   In this strategy, V shares some information (V_INFO) with a potential
   U, that can help it decide whether to try to enroll with that V.

   The exact contents of the V_INFO structure, as well as the mechanism
   used to transport it, will depend on the underlying communication
   technology and also on application needs.  For example, V_INFO may
   state that:

   *  V implements ELA -- similarly to how EAPOL [IEEE802.1X] frames
      state support for IEEE 802.1X.

   *  V is part of a certain domain -- similarly to how Eduroam
      [RFC7593] is used in the SSID field of IEEE 802.11 packets

   V_INFO can be sent over a network beacon (see Appendix A.2.1), which
   may require technology specific profiling, e.g., the IEEE 802.15.4
   enhanced beacon may be extended according to [RFC8137].
   Alternatively, V_INFO can be sent as part of an EAD field, as shown
   in Appendix A.2.2.

   As a guideline for implementers, we define the following field that
   can be included in a V_INFO structure:

   DOMAIN_ID: bstr

   The DOMAIN_ID field identifies the domain to which V belongs to, for
   example an URL or UUID.

   Below are three examples of how the advertisement strategy may be
   applied according to different application needs.  The examples
   include sending V_INFO in network beacons, as part of EAD_1 in
   reverse message flow, or as part of a periodic CoAP multicast packet.
   The advantages, costs, and security impacts of each approach are also
   discussed.

A.2.1.  V_INFO in network beacons

   This approach allows carrying V_INFO in beacons sent over the network
   layer, as shown in Figure 8.  It requires that the network layer
   offers a mechanism to configure its beacon packets.  Depending on the
   network type, a solicitation packet may also be needed, as is the
   case of non-beaconed IEEE 802.15.4 and BLE with GATT.

                |        (?EAD_1 = Voucher_Info)         |

                 ( ... protocol continues normally ... )

      Figure 8: Advertising ELA using V_INFO in network-layer beacons.

   This strategy can be used, for example, in IEEE 802.15.4, where an
   Enhanced Beacon [IEEE802.15.4] can be used to transmit V_INFO.
   Specifically, a new information element for carrying V_INFO can be
   defined according to [RFC8137].

   This approach has the advantage of requiring minimal changes to the
   default protocol as presented in Section 4.1, i.e., no reverse flow.
   It requires, however, some profiling of the lower layer beacons.

A.2.2.  V_INFO in EAD_1

   The ELA reverse flow (see Section 4.8) allows implementing
   advertising where U first sends a trigger packet, in the format of a
   CoAP request that is broadcasted to the newtork.  When a suitable V
   receives the solicitation, if it implements ELA, it should respond
   with an EDHOC message_1 whose EAD_1 has label TBD1 and value V_INFO
   (see Section Appendix A).

                   |       (?EAD_1 = V_INFO)         |
                   |                                 |

                ( ... reverse flow continues normally ... )

       Figure 9: Advertising ELA using V_INFO in EAD_1, eploying the
                  EDHOC reverse flow with U as responder.

   Note that V will only reply if it supports ELA.  V_INFO can be
   structured to contain only an optional domain identifier:

   V_INFO = (
     ?DOMAIN_ID: bstr,
   )

   This approach enables a simple filtering mechanism, where only V's
   that support ELA will reply.  It also encrypts Voucher_Info (as part
   of EAD_2), whereas it is sent in the clear in the original flow.  In
   addition, it may not require layer-two profiling (in case the network
   allows transporting data before authorization).  Finally, note that
   the reverse flow with U as Responder protects the identity of V
   (instead of U's as in the forward flow).

A.2.3.  V_INFO in a CoAP Multicast Packet

   In this approach, V periodically multicasts a CoAP packet containing
   V_INFO, see Figure 10.  Upon receiving one or more CoAP messages and
   processing V_INFO, U can decide whether or not to initiate the ELA
   protocol with a given V.  Next, the application can either keep U
   acting as a server, and thus employ the EDHOC reverse flow, or
   implement a CoAP client and use the forward flow.

               |          (?EAD_1 = Voucher_Info)         |
               |                                          |

                ( ... protocol continues normally ... )

            Figure 10: Advertising ELA using the network layer.

   The V_INFO structure is sent as part of the CoAP payload.  It is
   encoded as a CBOR sequence:

   V_INFO = (
     ?DOMAIN_ID: bstr,
   )

   One advantage of this approach is that, since U is the initiator, its
   identity is protected in the context of the EDHOC handshake.  On the
   other hand, the periodic multicast may have resource usage impacts in
   the network.

Appendix B.  Use with Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP)

   This section outlines how ELA is used for network enrollment and
   parameter provisioning.  An IEEE 802.15.4 network is used as an
   example of how a new device (U) can be enrolled into the domain
   managed by the domain authenticator (V).

B.1.  Network Discovery

   When a device first boots, it needs to discover the network it
   attempts to join.  The network discovery procedure is defined by the
   link-layer technology in use.  In case of Time-slotted Channel
   Hopping (TSCH) networks, a mode of [IEEE802.15.4], the device scans
   the radio channels for Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames, a procedure known
   as passive scan.  EBs carry the information about the network, and
   particularly the network identifier.  Based on the EB, the network
   identifier, the information pre-configured into the device, the
   device makes the decision on whether it should join the network
   advertised by the received EB frame.  This process is described in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC9031].  In case of other, non-TSCH modes of IEEE
   802.15.4, it is possible to use the active scan procedure and send
   solicitation frames.  These solicitation frames trigger the nearest
   network coordinator to respond by emitting a beacon frame.  The
   network coordinator emitting beacons may be multiple link-layer hops
   away from the domain authenticator (V), in which case it plays the
   role of a Join Proxy (see [RFC9031]).  The Join Proxy does not
   participate in the protocol and acts as a transparent router between
   the device and the domain authenticator.  For simplicity, Figure 11
   illustrates the case when the device and the domain authenticator are
   a single hop away and can communicate directly.

B.2.  The Enrollment Protocol with Parameter Provisioning

B.2.1.  Flight 1

   Once the device has discovered the network it wants to join, it
   constructs EDHOC message_1, as described in Section 4.5.  The device
   SHALL map the message to a CoAP request:

   *  The request method is POST.

   *  The type is Confirmable (CON).

   *  The Proxy-Scheme option is set to "coap".

   *  The Uri-Host option is set to "lake-authz.arpa".  This is an
      anycast type of identifier of the domain authenticator (V) that is
      resolved to its IPv6 address by the Join Proxy.

   *  By means of Uri-Path options, the Uri-Path is set to ".well-known/
      edhoc".

   *  The payload is the (true, EDHOC message_1) CBOR sequence, where
      EDHOC message_1 is constructed as defined in Section 4.5.

B.2.2.  Flight 2

   The domain authenticator receives message_1 and processes it as
   described in Section 4.5.  The message triggers the exchange with the
   enrollment server, as described in Section 4.6.  If the exchange
   between V and W completes successfully, the domain authenticator
   prepares EDHOC message_2, as described in Section 4.5.  The
   authenticator SHALL map the message to a CoAP response:

   *  The response code is 2.04 Changed.

   *  The payload is the EDHOC message_2, as defined in Section 4.5.

B.2.3.  Flight 3

   The device receives EDHOC message_2 and processes it as described in
   Section 4.5.  Upon successful processing of message_2, the device
   prepares flight 3, which is an OSCORE-protected CoJP request
   containing an EDHOC message_3, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc].  EDHOC message_3 is prepared as
   described in Section 4.5.  The OSCORE-protected payload is the CoJP
   Join Request object specified in Section 8.4.1 of [RFC9031].  OSCORE
   protection leverages the OSCORE Security Context derived from the
   EDHOC session, as specified in Appendix A of [RFC9528].  To that end,
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] specifies that the Sender ID of the
   client (device) must be set to the connection identifier selected by
   the domain authenticator, C_R.  OSCORE includes the Sender ID as the
   kid in the OSCORE option.  The network identifier in the CoJP Join
   Request object is set to the network identifier obtained from the
   network discovery phase.  In case of IEEE 802.15.4 networks, this is
   the PAN ID.

   The device SHALL map the message to a CoAP request:

   *  The request method is POST.

   *  The type is Confirmable (CON).

   *  The Proxy-Scheme option is set to "coap".

   *  The Uri-Host option is set to "lake-authz.arpa".

   *  The Uri-Path option is set to ".well-known/edhoc".

   *  The EDHOC option [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] is set and is empty.

   *  The payload is prepared as described in Section 3.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc], with EDHOC message_3 and the CoJP
      Join Request object as the OSCORE-protected payload.

   Note that the OSCORE Sender IDs are derived from the connection
   identifiers of the EDHOC session.  This is in contrast with [RFC9031]
   where ID Context of the OSCORE Security Context is set to the device
   identifier (pledge identifier).  Since the device identity is
   exchanged during the EDHOC session, and the certificate of the device
   is communicated to the authenticator as part of the Voucher Response
   message, there is no need to transport the device identity in OSCORE
   messages.  The authenticator playing the role of the [RFC9031] JRC
   obtains the device identity from the execution of the authorization
   protocol.

B.2.4.  Flight 4

   Flight 4 is the OSCORE response carrying CoJP response message.  The
   message is processed as specified in Section 8.4.2 of [RFC9031].

Appendix C.  Examples

   This section presents high level examples of the protocol execution.

   Note: the examples below include samples of access policies used by
   W.  These are provided for the sake of completeness only, since the
   authorization mechanism used by W is out of scope in this document.

C.1.  Minimal

   This is a simple example that demonstrates a successful execution of
   ELA.

   Premises:

   *  device u1 has ID_U = key id = 14

   *  the access policy in W specifies, via a list of ID_U, that device
      u1 can enroll via any domain authenticator, i.e., the list
      contains ID_U = 14.  In this case, the policy only specifies a
      restriction in terms of U, effectively allowing enrollment via any
      V.

   Execution:

   1.  device u1 discovers a gateway (v1) and tries to enroll

   2.  gateway v1 identifies the zero-touch join attempt by checking
       that the label of EAD_1 = TBD1, and prepares a Voucher Request
       using the information contained in the value of EAD_1

   3.  upon receiving the request, W obtains ID_U = 14, authorizes the
       access, and replies with Voucher Response

C.2.  Wrong gateway

   In this example, a device u1 tries to enroll a domain via gateway v1,
   but W denies the request because the pairing (u1, v1) is not
   configured in its access policies.

   This example also illustrates how the REJECT_INFO field of the EDHOC
   error Access Denied could be used, in this case to suggest that the
   device should select another gateway for the join procedure.

   Premises:

   *  devices and gateways communicate via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
      therefore their network identifiers are MAC addresses (EUI-48)

   *  device u1 has ID_U = key id = 14

   *  there are 3 gateways in the radio range of u1:

      -  v1 with MAC address = A2-A1-88-EE-97-75

      -  v2 with MAC address = 28-0F-70-84-51-E4

      -  v3 with MAC address = 39-63-C9-D0-5C-62

   *  the access policy in W specifies, via a mapping of shape (ID_U;
      MAC1, MAC2, ...) that device u1 can only join via gateway v3,
      i.e., the mapping is: (14; 39-63-C9-D0-5C-62)

   *  W is able to map the PoP key of the gateways to their respective
      MAC addresses

   Execution:

   1.  device u1 tries to join via gateway v1, which forwards the
       request to W

   2.  W determines that MAC address A2-A1-88-EE-97-75 is not in the
       access policy mapping, and replies with an error.  The
       error_content has REJECT_TYPE = 1, and the plaintext OPAQUE_INFO
       (used to compute the encrypted REJECT_INFO) specifies a list of
       suggested gateways = [h'3963C9D05C62'].  The single element in
       the list is the 6-byte MAC address of v3, serialized as a bstr.

   3.  gateway v1 assembles an EDHOC error "Access Denied" with
       error_content, and sends it to u1

   4.  device u1 processes the error, decrypts REJECT_INFO, and retries
       the protocol via gateway v3
