1.  Introduction

   For constrained IoT deployments [RFC7228] the overhead and processing
   contributed by security protocols may be significant, which motivates
   the specification of lightweight protocols that are optimizing, in
   particular, message overhead (see [I-D.ietf-lake-reqs]).  This
   document describes a procedure for augmenting the lightweight
   authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange EDHOC [RFC9528] with third
   party-assisted authorization.

   The procedure involves a device, a domain authenticator, and an
   enrollment server.  The device and domain authenticator perform
   mutual authentication and authorization, assisted by the enrollment
   server that provides relevant authorization information to the device
   (a "voucher") and to the authenticator.  The high-level model is
   similar to BRSKI [RFC8995].

   In this document, we consider the target interaction for which
   authorization is needed to be "enrollment", for example joining a
   network for the first time (e.g., [RFC9031]), but it can be applied
   to authorize other target interactions.

   The enrollment server may represent the manufacturer of the device,
   or some other party with information about the device from which a
   trust anchor has been pre-provisioned into the device.  The (domain)
   authenticator may represent the service provider or some other party
   controlling access to the network in which the device is enrolling.

   The protocol assumes that authentication between device and
   authenticator is performed with EDHOC [RFC9528], and defines the
   integration of a lightweight authorization procedure using the
   External Authorization Data (EAD) fields defined in EDHOC.

   The protocol enables a low message count by performing authorization
   and enrollment in parallel with authentication, instead of in
   sequence, which is common for network access.  It further reuses
   protocol elements from EDHOC, leading to reduced message sizes on
   constrained links.

   This protocol is applicable to a wide variety of settings, and can be
   mapped to different authorization architectures.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to have an understanding of CBOR [RFC8949], CDDL
   [RFC8610], and EDHOC [RFC9528].  Appendix C.1 of [RFC9528] contains
   some basic info about CBOR.

2.  Protocol Outline

   The goal of this protocol is to enable a (potentially constrained)
   device (U) to enroll into a domain over a constrained link.  The
   device authenticates and enforces authorization of the (non-
   constrained) domain authenticator (V) with the help of a voucher
   conveying authorization information.  The voucher has a similar role
   as in [RFC8366] but should be considerably more compact.  The domain
   authenticator, in turn, authenticates the device and authorizes its
   enrollment into the domain.

   The procedure is assisted by a (non-constrained) enrollment server
   (W) located in a non-constrained network behind the domain
   authenticator, e.g., on the Internet, providing information to the
   device (conveyed in the voucher) and to the domain authenticator as
   part of the protocol.

   The objective of this document is to specify such a protocol that is
   lightweight over the constrained link, by reusing elements of EDHOC
   [RFC9528] and by shifting message overhead to the non-constrained
   side of the network.  See illustration in Figure 1.

   Note the cardinality of the involved parties.  It is expected that
   the domain authenticator needs to handle a large unspecified number
   of devices, but for a given device type or manufacturer it is
   expected that one or a few nodes host enrollment servers.

                 Voucher

       Figure 1: Overview of the message flow.  EDHOC is used on the
      constrained link between U and V.  Voucher Info and Voucher are
         sent in EDHOC External Authorization Data (EAD).  The link
                    between V and W is not constrained.

3.  Assumptions

   The protocol is based on the following pre-existing relations between
   the device (U), the domain authenticator (V) and the enrollment
   server (W), see Figure 2.

   *  U and W have an explicit relation: U is configured with a public
      key of W, see Section 3.1.

   *  V and W have an implicit relation, e.g., based on web PKI with
      trusted CA certificates, see Section 3.2.

   *  U and V need not have any previous relation.  This protocol
      establishes a relation between U and V.

   Each of the three parties can gain protected communication with the
   other two during the protocol.

   V may be able to access credentials over non-constrained networks,
   but U may be limited to constrained networks.  Implementations
   wishing to leverage the zero-touch capabilities of this protocol are
   expected to support transmission of credentials from V to U by value
   during the EDHOC exchange, which will impact the message size
   depending on the type of credential used.

              Figure 2: Overview of pre-existing relations.

3.1.  Device (U)

   To authenticate to V, the device (U) runs EDHOC in the role of
   Initiator with authentication credential CRED_U, for example, an
   X.509 certificate [RFC5280] or a CBOR Web Token (CWT, [RFC8392]).
   CRED_U may, for example, be carried by value in ID_CRED_I of EDHOC
   message_3 or be provisioned to V over a non-constrained network,
   leveraging a credential identifier in ID_CRED_I (see bottom of
   Figure 3).

   U also needs to identify itself to W.  The device identifier used for
   this is ID_U.  The purpose of ID_U is for W to be able to determine
   if the device with this identifier is authorized to enroll with V.
   ID_U may be a reference to CRED_U, like ID_CRED_I in EDHOC (see
   Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528]), or a device identifier from a different
   name space, such as EUI-64 identifiers.

   U is also provisioned with information about W:

   *  A static public DH key of W (G_W) used to establish secure
      communication with the enrollment server (see Section 4.4).

   *  Location information about the enrollment server (LOC_W) that can
      be used by V to reach W.  This is typically a URI but may
      alternatively be only the domain name.

3.2.  Domain Authenticator (V)

   To authenticate to U, the domain authenticator (V) runs EDHOC in the
   role of Responder with an authentication credential CRED_V containing
   a public key of V, see Section 4.5.2.1.  This proves to U the
   possession of the private key corresponding to the public key of
   CRED_V.  CRED_V typically needs to be transported to U in EDHOC
   (using ID_CRED_R = CRED_V, see Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528]) since
   there is no previous relation between U and V.

   V and W need to establish a secure (confidentiality and integrity
   protected) connection for the Voucher Request/Response protocol.
   Furthermore, W needs to access the same credential CRED_V that V uses
   with U (to compute the Voucher), and V needs to prove to W the
   possession of the private key corresponding to the public key of
   CRED_V.  It is RECOMMENDED that V authenticates to W using the same
   credential CRED_V as with U.

   Note that the choice of protocols may affect which type of credential
   and methods should be used by V.  For example, in case V and W select
   TLS for the secure channel and PoP, then CRED_V is a X.509
   certificate, and the EDHOC method used by V is signature-based.  Some
   of the possible combinations of protocols to secure the connection
   between V and W are listed in Table 1 below.

     Table 1: Examples of how to secure the connection between V and W.

   Note also that the secure connection between V and W may be long-
   lived and reused for multiple voucher requests/responses.

   Other details of proof-of-possession related to CRED_V and transport
   of CRED_V are out of scope of this document.

3.3.  Enrollment Server (W)

   The enrollment server (W) is assumed to have the private DH key
   corresponding to G_W, which is used to establish secure communication
   with the device (see Section 4.4).  W provides to U the authorization
   decision for enrollment with V in the form of a voucher (see
   Section 4.4.2).  Authorization policies are out of scope for this
   document.

   Authentication credentials and communication security with V is
   described in Section 3.2.  To calculate the voucher, W needs access
   to message_1 and CRED_V as used in the EDHOC session between U and V,
   see Section 4.4.2.

   *  W MUST verify that CRED_V is bound to the secure connection
      between W and V

   *  W MUST verify that V is in possession of the private key
      corresponding to the public key of CRED_V

   W needs to be available during the execution of the protocol between
   U and V.

4.  The Protocol

4.1.  Overview

   The protocol consist of three security sessions going on in parallel:

   1.  The EDHOC session between device (U) and (domain) authenticator
       (V)

   2.  Voucher Request/Response between authenticator (V) and enrollment
       server (W)

   3.  An exchange of voucher-related information, including the voucher
       itself, between device (U) and enrollment server (W), mediated by
       the authenticator (V).

   Figure 3 provides an overview of the message flow detailed in this
   section.  An outline of EDHOC is given in Section 2 of [RFC9528].

  Figure 3: Overview of the protocol: W-assisted authorization of U
   and V to each other: EDHOC between U and V, and Voucher Request/
     Response between V and W.  Before the protocol, V and W are
  assumed to have established a secure channel and performed proof-
   of-possession of relevant keys.  Credential lookup of CRED_U may
               involve W or other credential database.

4.2.  Reuse of EDHOC

   The protocol illustrated in Figure 3 reuses several components of
   EDHOC:

   *  G_X, the ephemeral public Diffie-Hellman key of U, is also used in
      the protocol between U and W.

   *  SUITES_I includes the cipher suite for EDHOC selected by U, and
      also defines the algorithms used between U and W (see Section 3.6
      of [RFC9528]):

      -  EDHOC AEAD algorithm: used to encrypt ID_U and to generate
         voucher

      -  EDHOC hash algorithm: used for key derivation

      -  EDHOC key exchange algorithm: used to calculate the shared
         secret between U and W

   *  EAD_1, EAD_2 are the External Authorization Data message fields of
      message_1 and message_2, respectively, see Section 3.8 of
      [RFC9528].  This document specifies the EAD items with ead_label =
      TBD1, see Section 7.1).

   *  ID_CRED_I and ID_CRED_R are used to identify the authentication
      credentials CRED_U and CRED_V, respectively.  As shown at the
      bottom of Figure 3, V may use W to obtain CRED_U.  CRED_V is
      transported in ID_CRED_R in message_2, see Section 4.5.2.1.

   The protocol also reuses the EDHOC_Extract and EDHOC_Expand key
   derivation from EDHOC (see Section 4 of [RFC9528]).

   *  The intermediate pseudo-random key PRK is derived using
      EDHOC_Extract():

      -  PRK = EDHOC_Extract(salt, IKM)

         o  where salt = 0x (the zero-length byte string)

         o  IKM is computed as an ECDH cofactor Diffie-Hellman shared
            secret from the public key of W, G_W, and the private key
            corresponding to G_X (or v.v.), see Section 5.7.1.2 of
            [NIST-800-56A].

   The output keying material OKM is derived from PRK using
   EDHOC_Expand(), which is defined in terms of the EDHOC hash algorithm
   of the selected cipher suite, see Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9528]:

   *  OKM = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length)

      where

   info = (
      info_label : int,
      context : bstr,
      length : uint,
   )

4.3.  Stateless Operation of V

   V may act statelessly with respect to U: the state of the EDHOC
   session started by U may be dropped at V until authorization from W
   is received.  Once V has received EDHOC message_1 from U and
   extracted LOC_W from EAD_1, message_1 is forwarded unmodified to W in
   the form of a Voucher Request (see Section 4.6.1).  V encapsulates
   the internal state that it needs to later respond to U, and sends
   that to W together with EDHOC message_1.  This state typically
   contains addressing information of U (e.g., U's IP address and port
   number), together with any other implementation-specific parameter
   needed by V to respond to U.  At this point, V can drop the EDHOC
   session that was initiated by U.

   The encapsulated state MUST be protected using a uniformly-
   distributed (pseudo-)random key, known only to itself and specific
   for the current EDHOC session to prevent replay attacks of old
   encapsulated state.

   How V serializes and encrypts its internal state is out of scope in
   this specification.  For example, V may use CBOR and COSE.

   Editor's note: Consider to include an example of serialized internal
   state.

   W sends to V the voucher together with the echoed message_1, as
   received from U, and V's internal state, see Section 4.6.2.  This
   allows V to act as a simple message relay until it has obtained the
   authorization from W to enroll U.  The reception of a successful
   Voucher Response at V from W implies the authorization for V to
   enroll U.  At this point, V can initialize a new EDHOC session with
   U, based on the message and the state retrieved from the Voucher
   Response from W.

4.4.  Device <-> Enrollment Server (U <-> W)

   The protocol between U and W is carried between U and V in message_1
   and message_2 (Section 4.5), and between V and W in the Voucher
   Request/Response (Section 4.6).  The data is protected between the
   endpoints using secret keys derived from a Diffie-Hellman shared
   secret (see Section 4.2) as further detailed in this section.

4.4.1.  Voucher Info

   The external authorization data EAD_1 contains an EAD item with
   ead_label = TBD1 and ead_value = Voucher_Info, which is a CBOR byte
   string:

   Voucher_Info = bstr .cborseq Voucher_Info_Seq

   Voucher_Info_Seq = [ ; used as a CBOR sequence, not array
       LOC_W:      tstr,
       ENC_U_INFO:     bstr
   ]

   where

   *  LOC_W is a text string used by V to locate W, e.g., a URI or a
      domain name.

   *  ENC_U_INFO is a byte string containing an encrypted identifier of
      U and, optionally, opaque application data prepared by U.  It is
      calculated as follows:

   ENC_U_INFO is encrypted using the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the
   selected cipher suite specified in SUITE_I of EDHOC message_1.  It
   consists of 'ciphertext' of COSE_Encrypt0 (Section 5.2 of [RFC9052])
   computed from the following:

   *  The encryption key K_1 and nonce IV_1 are derived as specified
      below.

   *  'protected' is a byte string of size 0

   *  'plaintext' and 'external_aad' as below:

   plaintext = (
       ID_U:            bstr,
       ?OPAQUE_INFO:    bstr,
   )

   external_aad = (
       SS:              int,
   )

   where

   *  ID_U is an identifier of the device, see Section 3.1.

   *  OPAQUE_INFO is an opaque field provided by the application.  If
      present, it will contain application data that U may want to
      convey to W, e.g., enrollment hints, see Appendix B.  Note that
      OPAQUE_INFO is opaque when viewed as an information element in
      EDHOC.  It is opaque to V, while the application in U and W can
      read its contents.  The same applies to other references of
      OPAQUE_INFO throughout this document.

   *  SS is the selected cipher suite in SUITES_I of EDHOC message_1,
      see Section 4.5.

   The external_aad is wrapped in an enc_structure as defined in
   Section 5.3 of [RFC9052].

   Editor's note: Add more context to external_aad.

   The derivation of K_1 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see OKM in Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 0

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the key of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes
      (which is the length of K_1)

   The derivation of IV_1 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see OKM in Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 1

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the nonce of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes
      (which is the length of IV_1)

4.4.2.  Voucher

   The voucher is an assertion to U that W has authorized V.  It is
   encrypted using the EDHOC AEAD algorithm of the selected cipher suite
   specified in SUITE_I of EDHOC message_1.  It consists of the
   'ciphertext' field of a COSE_Encrypt0 object, which is a byte string,
   as defined below.

   Voucher = bstr

   Its corresponding plaintext value consists of an opaque field that
   can be used by W to convey information to U, such as a voucher scope.
   The authentication tag present in the ciphertext is also bound to
   message_1 and the credential of V as described below.

   *  The encryption key K_2 and nonce IV_2 are derived as specified
      below.

   *  'protected' is a byte string of size 0

   *  'plaintext' and 'external_aad' as below:

   plaintext = (
       ?OPAQUE_INFO: bstr
   )

   external_aad = (
       H_message_1:  bstr,
       CRED_V:        bstr,
   )

   where

   *  OPAQUE_INFO is an opaque field provided by the application.

   *  H_message_1 is the hash of EDHOC message_1, calculated from the
      associated voucher request, see Section 4.6.1.  The hash is
      computed by using the EDHOC hash algorithm of the selected cipher
      suite specified in SUITE_I of EDHOC message_1.

   *  CRED_V is the credential used by V to authenticate to U and W, see
      Section 4.5.2.1 and Table 1.

   The derivation of K_2 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 2

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the key of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes

   The derivation of IV_2 = EDHOC_Expand(PRK, info, length) uses the
   following input to the info struct (see Section 4.2):

   *  info_label = 3

   *  context = h'' (the empty CBOR string)

   *  length is length of the nonce of the EDHOC AEAD algorithm in bytes

4.5.  Device <-> Authenticator (U <-> V)

   This section describes the processing in U and V, which includes the
   EDHOC protocol, see Figure 3.  Normal EDHOC processing is omitted
   here.

4.5.1.  Message 1

4.5.1.1.  Processing in U

   U composes EDHOC message_1 using authentication method, identifiers,
   etc. according to an agreed application profile, see Section 3.9 of
   [RFC9528].  The selected cipher suite, in this document denoted SS,
   applies also to the interaction with W as detailed in Section 4.2, in
   particular, with respect to the Diffie-Hellman key agreement
   algorithm used between U and W.  As part of the normal EDHOC
   processing, U generates the ephemeral public key G_X that is reused
   in the interaction with W, see Section 4.4.

   The device sends EDHOC message_1 with EAD item (-TBD1, Voucher_Info)
   included in EAD_1, where Voucher_Info is specified in Section 4.4.
   The negative sign indicates that the EAD item is critical, see
   Section 3.8 of [RFC9528].

4.5.1.2.  Processing in V

   V receives EDHOC message_1 from U and processes it as specified in
   Section 5.2.3 of [RFC9528], with the additional step of processing
   the EAD item in EAD_1.  Since the EAD item is critical, if V does not
   recognize it or it contains information that V cannot process, then V
   MUST abort the EDHOC session, see Section 3.8 of [RFC9528].
   Otherwise, the ead_label = TBD1 triggers the voucher request to W as
   described in Section 4.6.  The exchange between V and W needs to be
   completed successfully for the EDHOC session to be continued.

4.5.2.  Message 2

4.5.2.1.  Processing in V

   V receives the voucher response from W as described in Section 4.6.

   V sends EDHOC message_2 to U with the critical EAD item (-TBD1,
   Voucher) included in EAD_2, i.e., ead_label = TBD1 and ead_value =
   Voucher, as specified in Section 4.4.2.

   The type of CRED_V may depend on the selected mechanism for the
   establishment of a secure channel between V and W, See Table 1.

   In case the network between U and V is constrained, it is recommended
   that CRED_V be a CWT Claims Set (CCS) [RFC8392].  The CCS contains
   the public authentication key of V encoded as a COSE_Key in the 'cnf'
   claim, see Section 3.5.2 of [RFC9528].  ID_CRED_R contains the CWT
   Claims Set with 'kccs' as COSE header_map, see Section 10.6 of
   [RFC9528].

4.5.2.2.  Processing in U

   U receives EDHOC message_2 from V and processes it as specified in
   Section 5.3.3 of [RFC9528], with the additional step of processing
   the EAD item in EAD_2.

   If U does not recognize the EAD item or the EAD item contains
   information that U cannot process, then U MUST abort the EDHOC
   session, see Section 3.8 of [RFC9528].  Otherwise, U MUST verify the
   Voucher using H_message_1, CRED_V, and the keys derived as in
   Section 4.4.2.  If the verification fails then U MUST abort the EDHOC
   session.

4.5.3.  Message 3

4.5.3.1.  Processing in U

   If all verifications are passed, then U sends EDHOC message_3.

   EDHOC message_3 may be combined with an OSCORE-protected application
   request, see [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc].

4.5.3.2.  Processing in V

   V performs the normal EDHOC verifications of message_3.  V may
   retrieve CRED_U from a Credential Database, after having learned
   ID_CRED_I from U.

4.6.  Authenticator <-> Enrollment Server (V <-> W)

   It is assumed that V and W have set up a secure connection, W has
   accessed the authentication credential CRED_V to be used in the EDHOC
   session between V and U, and that W has verified that V is in
   possession of the private key corresponding to CRED_V, see
   Section 3.2 and Section 3.3.  V and W run the Voucher Request/
   Response protocol over the secure connection.

4.6.1.  Voucher Request

4.6.1.1.  Processing in V

   V sends the voucher request to W.  The Voucher Request SHALL be a
   CBOR array as defined below:

   Voucher_Request = [
       message_1:      bstr,
       ? opaque_state: bstr
   ]

   where

   *  message_1 is a CBOR byte string whose value is the byte
      serialization of EDHOC message_1 as it was received from U.

   *  opaque_state is OPTIONAL and represents the serialized and
      encrypted opaque state needed by V to statelessly respond to U
      after the reception of Voucher_Response.

4.6.1.2.  Processing in W

   W receives and parses the voucher request received over the secure
   connection with V.  The voucher request essentially contains EDHOC
   message_1 as sent by U to V.  W SHALL NOT process message_1 as if it
   was an EDHOC message intended for W.

   W extracts from message_1:

   *  SS - the selected cipher suite, which is the (last) integer of
      SUITES_I.

   *  G_X - the ephemeral public key of U

   *  ENC_U_INFO - the encryption of (1) the device identifier ID_U and
      (2) the optional OPAQUE_INFO field, contained in the Voucher_Info
      field of the EAD item with ead_label = TBD1 (with minus sign
      indicating criticality)

   W verifies and decrypts ENC_U_INFO using the relevant algorithms of
   the selected cipher suite SS (see Section 4.2), and obtains ID_U.

   In case OPAQUE_INFO is present, it is made available to the
   application.

   W calculates the hash of message_1 H_message_1, and associates this
   session identifier to the device identifier ID_U.  Note that
   message_1 contains a unique ephemeral key, therefore H_message_1 is
   expected to be unique.

   If processing fails up until this point, the protocol SHALL be
   aborted with an error code signaling a generic issue with the
   request, see Section 5.4.1.

   W uses ID_U to look up the associated authorization policies for U
   and enforces them.  This is out of scope for the specification.

   If ID_U is known by W, but authorization fails, the protocol SHALL be
   aborted with an error code signaling an access control issue, see
   Section 4.7 and Section 5.4.1.

4.6.2.  Voucher Response

4.6.2.1.  Processing in W

   W retrieves CRED_V associated with the secure connection with V, and
   constructs the Voucher for the device with identifier ID_U (see
   Section 4.4.2).

   W generates the voucher response and sends it to V over the secure
   connection.  The Voucher_Response SHALL be a CBOR array as defined
   below:

   Voucher_Response = [
       message_1:      bstr,
       Voucher:        bstr,
       ? opaque_state: bstr
   ]

   where

   *  message_1 is a CBOR byte string whose value is the byte
      serialization of EDHOC message_1 as it was received from V.

   *  The Voucher is defined in Section 4.4.2.

   *  opaque_state is the echoed byte string opaque_state from
      Voucher_Request, if present.

   W signals the successful generation of the voucher via a status code
   in the REST interface, as defined in Section 5.4.1.

4.6.2.2.  Processing in V

   V receives the voucher response from W over the secure connection.
   If present, V decrypts and verifies opaque_state as received from W.
   If that verification fails, then the EDHOC session with U is aborted.
   If the voucher response is successfully received from W, then V
   responds to U with EDHOC message_2 as described in Section 4.5.2.1.

4.7.  Error Handling

   This section specifies a new EDHOC error code and how it is used in
   the proposed protocol.

4.7.1.  EDHOC Error "Access denied"

   This section specifies the new EDHOC error "Access denied", see
   Figure 4.

  +----------+----------------+----------------------------------------+
  | ERR_CODE | ERR_INFO Type  | Description                            |
  +==========+================+========================================+
  |     TBD3 | error_content  | Access denied                          |
  +----------+----------------+----------------------------------------+

  Figure 4: EDHOC error code and error information for ‘Access denied’.

   Error code TBD3 is used to indicate to the receiver that access
   control has been applied and the sender has aborted the EDHOC
   session.  The ERR_INFO field contains error_content which is a CBOR
   Sequence consisting of an integer and an optional byte string.

   error_content = (
     REJECT_TYPE : int,
     ? REJECT_INFO : bstr,
   )

   The purpose of REJECT_INFO is for the sender to provide verifiable
   and actionable information to the receiver about the error, so that
   an automated action may be taken to enable access.

  +-------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+
  | REJECT_TYPE | REJECT_INFO   | Description                          |
  +=============+===============+======================================+
  |           0 | -             | No REJECT_INFO                       |
  +-------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+
  |           1 | bstr          | REJECT_INFO from trusted third party |
  +-------------+---------------+--------------------------------------+

        Figure 5: REJECT_TYPE and REJECT_INFO for ‘Access denied’.

4.7.2.  Error handling in W, V, and U

   This protocol uses the EDHOC Error "Access denied" in the following
   way:

   *  W generates error_content and transfers it to V via the secure
      connection.  If REJECT_TYPE is 1, then REJECT_INFO is encrypted
      from W to U using the EDHOC AEAD algorithm.  W signals the error
      via an appropriate status code in the REST interface, as defined
      in Section 5.4.1.

   *  V receives error_content, prepares an EDHOC "Access denied" error,
      and sends it to U.

   *  U receives the error message and extracts the error_content.  If
      REJECT_TYPE is 1, then U decrypts REJECT_INFO, based on which it
      may retry to gain access.

   The encryption of REJECT_INFO follows a procedure analogous to the
   one defined in Section 4.4.2, with the following differences:

   plaintext = (
       OPAQUE_INFO:     bstr,
    )

   external_aad = (
       H_message_1:    bstr,
    )

   where

   *  OPAQUE_INFO is an opaque field that contains actionable
      information about the error.  It may contain, for example, a list
      of suggested Vs through which U should join instead.

   *  H_message_1 is the hash of EDHOC message_1, calculated from the
      associated voucher request, see Section 4.6.1.

5.  REST Interface at W

   The interaction between V and W is enabled through a RESTful
   interface exposed by W.  This RESTful interface MAY be implemented
   using either HTTP or CoAP.  V SHOULD access the resources exposed by
   W through the protocol indicated by the scheme in the LOC_W URI.

5.1.  Scheme "https"

   In case the scheme indicates "https", V MUST perform a TLS handshake
   with W and access the resources defined in Section 5.4 using HTTP.
   If the authentication credential CRED_V can be used in a TLS
   handshake, e.g., an X.509 certificate of a signature public key, then
   V SHOULD use it to authenticate to W as a client.  If the
   authentication credential CRED_V cannot be used in a TLS handshake,
   e.g., if the public key is a static Diffie-Hellman key, then V SHOULD
   first perform a TLS handshake with W using available compatible keys.
   V MUST then perform an EDHOC session over the TLS connection proving
   to W the possession of the private key corresponding to CRED_V.
   Performing the EDHOC session is only necessary if V did not
   authenticate with CRED_V in the TLS handshake with W.

   Editor's note: Clarify that performing TLS handshake is not necessary
   for each device request; if there already is a TLS connection between
   V and W that should be reused.  Similar considerations for 5.2 and
   5.3.

5.2.  Scheme "coaps"

   In case the scheme indicates "coaps", V SHOULD perform a DTLS
   handshake with W and access the resources defined in Section 5.4
   using CoAP.  The normative requirements in Section 5.1 on performing
   the DTLS handshake and EDHOC session remain the same, except that TLS
   is replaced with DTLS.

5.3.  Scheme "coap"

   In case the scheme indicates "coap", V SHOULD perform an EDHOC
   session with W, as specified in Appendix A of [RFC9528] and access
   the resources defined in Section 5.4 using OSCORE and CoAP.  The
   authentication credential in this EDHOC session MUST be CRED_V.

5.4.  URIs

   The URIs defined below are valid for both HTTP and CoAP.  W MUST
   support the use of the path-prefix "/.well-known/", as defined in
   [RFC8615], and the registered name "lake-authz".  A valid URI in case
   of HTTP thus begins with

   *  "https://www.example.com/.well-known/lake-authz"

   In case of CoAP with DTLS:

   *  "coaps://example.com/.well-known/lake-authz"

   In case of EDHOC and OSCORE:

   *  "coap://example.com/.well-known/lake-authz"

   Each operation specified in the following is indicated by a path-
   suffix.

5.4.1.  Voucher Request (/voucherrequest)

   To request a voucher, V MUST issue a request such that:

   *  Method is POST

   *  Payload is the serialization of the Voucher Request object, as
      specified in Section 4.6.1.

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      voucherrequest+cbor"

   In case of successful processing at W, W MUST issue a response such
   that:

   *  Status code is 200 OK if using HTTP, or 2.04 Changed if using CoAP

   *  Payload is the serialized Voucher Response object, as specified in
      Section 4.6.2

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      voucherresponse+cbor"

   In case of error, two cases should be considered:

   *  U cannot be identified: this happens either if W fails to process
      the Voucher Request, or if it succeeds but ID_U is considered
      unknown to W.  In this case, W MUST reply with 400 Bad Request if
      using HTTP, or 4.00 if using CoAP.

   *  U is identified but unauthorized: this happens if W is able to
      process the Voucher Request, and W recognizes ID_U as a known
      device, but the access policies forbid enrollment.  For example,
      the policy could enforce enrollment within a delimited time
      window, via a specific V, etc.  In this case, W MUST reply with a
      403 Forbidden code if using HTTP, or 4.03 if using CoAP; the
      payload is the serialized error_content object, with Content-
      Format (Content-Type) set to "application/lake-authz-
      vouchererror+cbor".  The payload MAY be used by V to prepare an
      EDHOC error "Access Denied", see Section 4.7.

5.4.2.  Certificate Request (/certrequest)

   V requests the public key certificate of U from W through the
   "/certrequest" path-suffix.  To request U's authentication
   credential, V MUST issue a request such that:

   *  Method is POST

   *  Payload is the serialization of the ID_CRED_I object, as received
      in EDHOC message_3.

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      certrequest+cbor"

   In case of a successful lookup of the authentication credential at W,
   W MUST issue a response such that:

   *  Status code is 200 OK if using HTTP, or 2.04 Changed if using CoAP

   *  Payload is the serialized CRED_U

   *  Content-Format (Content-Type) is set to "application/lake-authz-
      certresponse+cbor"

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification builds on and reuses many of the security
   constructions of EDHOC, e.g., shared secret calculation and key
   derivation.  The security considerations of EDHOC [RFC9528] apply
   with modifications discussed here.

   EDHOC provides identity protection of the Initiator, here the device.
   The encryption of the device identifier ID_U in the first message
   should consider potential information leaking from the length of
   ID_U, either by making all identifiers having the same length or the
   use of a padding scheme.

   Although W learns about the identity of U after receiving VREQ, this
   information must not be disclosed to V, until U has revealed its
   identity to V with ID_CRED_I in message_3.  W may be used for lookup
   of CRED_U from ID_CRED_I, or this credential lookup function may be
   separate from the authorization function of W, see Figure 3.  The
   trust model used here is that U decides to which V it reveals its
   identity.  In an alternative trust model where U trusts W to decide
   to which V it reveals U's identity, CRED_U could be sent in Voucher
   Response.

   As noted in Section 9.2 of [RFC9528] an ephemeral key may be used to
   calculate several ECDH shared secrets.  In this specification, the
   ephemeral key G_X is also used to calculate G_XW, the shared secret
   with the enrollment server.

   The private ephemeral key is thus used in the device for calculations
   of key material relating to both the authenticator and the enrollment
   server.  There are different options for where to implement these
   calculations.  One option is as an addition to EDHOC, i.e., to extend
   the EDHOC API in the device, so that EDHOC can import the public key
   of W (G_W) and the device identifier of U (ID_U), and then produce
   the encryption of ID_U which is included in Voucher_Info in EAD_1.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  EDHOC External Authorization Data Registry

   IANA has registered the following entry in the "EDHOC External
   Authorization Data" registry under the group name "Ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)".  The ead_label = TBD1 corresponds to the
   ead_value Voucher_Info in EAD_1, and Voucher in EAD_2 with processing
   specified in Section 4.5.1 and Section 4.5.2, respectively, of this
   document.

Appendix A.  Use with Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP)

   This section outlines how the protocol is used for network enrollment
   and parameter provisioning.  An IEEE 802.15.4 network is used as an
   example of how a new device (U) can be enrolled into the domain
   managed by the domain authenticator (V).

A.1.  Network Discovery

   When a device first boots, it needs to discover the network it
   attempts to join.  The network discovery procedure is defined by the
   link-layer technology in use.  In case of Time-slotted Channel
   Hopping (TSCH) networks, a mode of [IEEE802.15.4], the device scans
   the radio channels for Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames, a procedure known
   as passive scan.  EBs carry the information about the network, and
   particularly the network identifier.  Based on the EB, the network
   identifier, the information pre-configured into the device, the
   device makes the decision on whether it should join the network
   advertised by the received EB frame.  This process is described in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC9031].  In case of other, non-TSCH modes of IEEE
   802.15.4, it is possible to use the active scan procedure and send
   solicitation frames.  These solicitation frames trigger the nearest
   network coordinator to respond by emitting a beacon frame.  The
   network coordinator emitting beacons may be multiple link-layer hops
   away from the domain authenticator (V), in which case it plays the
   role of a Join Proxy (see [RFC9031]).  The Join Proxy does not
   participate in the protocol and acts as a transparent router between
   the device and the domain authenticator.  For simplicity, Figure 6
   illustrates the case when the device and the domain authenticator are
   a single hop away and can communicate directly.

A.2.  The Enrollment Protocol with Parameter Provisioning

A.2.1.  Flight 1

   Once the device has discovered the network it wants to join, it
   constructs EDHOC message_1, as described in Section 4.5.  The device
   SHALL map the message to a CoAP request:

   *  The request method is POST.

   *  The type is Confirmable (CON).

   *  The Proxy-Scheme option is set to "coap".

   *  The Uri-Host option is set to "lake-authz.arpa".  This is an
      anycast type of identifier of the domain authenticator (V) that is
      resolved to its IPv6 address by the Join Proxy.

   *  By means of Uri-Path options, the Uri-Path is set to ".well-known/
      edhoc".

   *  The payload is the (true, EDHOC message_1) CBOR sequence, where
      EDHOC message_1 is constructed as defined in Section 4.5.

A.2.2.  Flight 2

   The domain authenticator receives message_1 and processes it as
   described in Section 4.5.  The message triggers the exchange with the
   enrollment server, as described in Section 4.6.  If the exchange
   between V and W completes successfully, the domain authenticator
   prepares EDHOC message_2, as described in Section 4.5.  The
   authenticator SHALL map the message to a CoAP response:

   *  The response code is 2.04 Changed.

   *  The payload is the EDHOC message_2, as defined in Section 4.5.

A.2.3.  Flight 3

   The device receives EDHOC message_2 and processes it as described in
   Section 4.5.  Upon successful processing of message_2, the device
   prepares flight 3, which is an OSCORE-protected CoJP request
   containing an EDHOC message_3, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc].  EDHOC message_3 is prepared as
   described in Section 4.5.  The OSCORE-protected payload is the CoJP
   Join Request object specified in Section 8.4.1 of [RFC9031].  OSCORE
   protection leverages the OSCORE Security Context derived from the
   EDHOC session, as specified in Appendix A of [RFC9528].  To that end,
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] specifies that the Sender ID of the
   client (device) must be set to the connection identifier selected by
   the domain authenticator, C_R.  OSCORE includes the Sender ID as the
   kid in the OSCORE option.  The network identifier in the CoJP Join
   Request object is set to the network identifier obtained from the
   network discovery phase.  In case of IEEE 802.15.4 networks, this is
   the PAN ID.

   The device SHALL map the message to a CoAP request:

   *  The request method is POST.

   *  The type is Confirmable (CON).

   *  The Proxy-Scheme option is set to "coap".

   *  The Uri-Host option is set to "lake-authz.arpa".

   *  The Uri-Path option is set to ".well-known/edhoc".

   *  The EDHOC option [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc] is set and is empty.

   *  The payload is prepared as described in Section 3.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-edhoc], with EDHOC message_3 and the CoJP
      Join Request object as the OSCORE-protected payload.

   Note that the OSCORE Sender IDs are derived from the connection
   identifiers of the EDHOC session.  This is in contrast with [RFC9031]
   where ID Context of the OSCORE Security Context is set to the device
   identifier (pledge identifier).  Since the device identity is
   exchanged during the EDHOC session, and the certificate of the device
   is communicated to the authenticator as part of the Voucher Response
   message, there is no need to transport the device identity in OSCORE
   messages.  The authenticator playing the role of the [RFC9031] JRC
   obtains the device identity from the execution of the authorization
   protocol.

A.2.4.  Flight 4

   Flight 4 is the OSCORE response carrying CoJP response message.  The
   message is processed as specified in Section 8.4.2 of [RFC9031].

Appendix B.  Enrollment Hints

   This section defines items that can be used in the OPAQUE_INFO field
   of either EAD_1 or the Access Denied error response.  The purpose of
   the proposed items is to improve protocol scalability, aiming to
   reduce battery usage and enrollment delay.  The main use case is when
   several potential gateways (V) are detected by U's radio, which can
   lead to U trying to enroll (and failing) several times until it finds
   a suitable V.

B.1.  Domain Authenticator hints

   In case W denies the enrollment of U to a given V, a list of Domain
   Authenticator hints (v_hint) can be sent from W to U.  The hint is
   optional and is included in the REJECT_INFO item in the Access Denied
   error message.  It consists of a list of application-defined
   identifiers of V (e.g.  MAC addresses, SSIDs, PAN IDs, etc.), as
   defined below:

   v_hint = [ + bstr ]

B.2.  Device Hints

   U may send a Device hint (u_hint) so that it can help W to select
   which Vs to include in v_hint.  This can be useful in large scale
   scenarios with many gateways (V).  The hint is an optional field
   included in the OPAQUE_INFO field within EAD_1, and it must be
   encrypted.  The hint itself is application dependent, and can contain
   GPS coordinates, application-specific tags, the list of Vs detected
   by U, or other relevant information.  It is defined as follows:

   u_hint = [ + bstr ]

Appendix C.  Examples

   This section presents high level examples of the protocol execution.

   Note: the examples below include samples of access policies used by
   W.  These are provided for the sake of completeness only, since the
   authorization mechanism used by W is out of scope in this document.

C.1.  Minimal

   This is a simple example that demonstrates a successful execution of
   the protocol.

   Premises:

   *  device u1 has ID_U = key id = 14

   *  the access policy in W specifies, via a list of ID_U, that device
      u1 can enroll via any domain authenticator, i.e., the list
      contains ID_U = 14.  In this case, the policy only specifies a
      restriction in terms of U, effectively allowing enrollment via any
      V.

   Execution:

   1.  device u1 discovers a gateway (v1) and tries to enroll

   2.  gateway v1 identifies the zero-touch join attempt by checking
       that the label of EAD_1 = TBD1, and prepares a Voucher Request
       using the information contained in the value of EAD_1

   3.  upon receiving the request, W obtains ID_U = 14, authorizes the
       access, and replies with Voucher Response

C.2.  Wrong gateway

   In this example, a device u1 tries to enroll a domain via gateway v1,
   but W denies the request because the pairing (u1, v1) is not
   configured in its access policies.

   This example also illustrates how the REJECT_INFO field of the EDHOC
   error Access Denied could be used, in this case to suggest that the
   device should select another gateway for the join procedure.

   Premises:

   *  devices and gateways communicate via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
      therefore their network identifiers are MAC addresses (EUI-48)

   *  device u1 has ID_U = key id = 14

   *  there are 3 gateways in the radio range of u1:

      -  v1 with MAC address = A2-A1-88-EE-97-75

      -  v2 with MAC address = 28-0F-70-84-51-E4

      -  v3 with MAC address = 39-63-C9-D0-5C-62

   *  the access policy in W specifies, via a mapping of shape (ID_U;
      MAC1, MAC2, ...) that device u1 can only join via gateway v3,
      i.e., the mapping is: (14; 39-63-C9-D0-5C-62)

   *  W is able to map the PoP key of the gateways to their respective
      MAC addresses

   Execution:

   1.  device u1 tries to join via gateway v1, which forwards the
       request to W

   2.  W determines that MAC address A2-A1-88-EE-97-75 is not in the
       access policy mapping, and replies with an error.  The
       error_content has REJECT_TYPE = 1, and the plaintext OPAQUE_INFO
       (used to compute the encrypted REJECT_INFO) specifies a list of
       suggested gateways = [h'3963C9D05C62'].  The single element in
       the list is the 6-byte MAC address of v3, serialized as a bstr.

   3.  gateway v1 assembles an EDHOC error "Access Denied" with
       error_content, and sends it to u1

   4.  device u1 processes the error, decrypts REJECT_INFO, and retries
       the protocol via gateway v3
